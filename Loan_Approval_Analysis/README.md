 This a project for greyatom's course Python For DataScience.


### Learnings from the project

 •**Dataframe slicing**
•**Dataframe aggregation**
•**Pivot table operations**


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project you will learn to how to **manipulate data**(in tabular form) in order to get  the desired results.


### Challenges faced

 During the course of this project I found it difficult to remeber the different functions of pandas and numpy so I used the **CheatSheet** provided in this course.
